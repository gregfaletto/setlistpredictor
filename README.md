# setlistpredictor

## Summary

During my internship with Live Nation (Feb - May 2017), I created an algorithm to predict the future concert set lists of bands using their database on setlist.fm. A set list is an ordered list of the songs a band plays at a particular concert. https://www.setlist.fm/ contains a database of past concert set lists of each band, including the date and the location of the concert.

## Files

Here are descriptions of each of the files in this repository:

* **setlist.R:** My R code implementing the algorithm I created.

* **Live Nation description.pdf:** A description of how the algorithm works.

There is also a folder containing the LaTeX files for the description.
